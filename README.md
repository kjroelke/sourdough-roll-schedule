# Sourdough Dinner Roll Scheduler

A simple app that helps you build a schedule based on [this sourdough recipe](https://littlespoonfarm.com/soft-sourdough-dinner-rolls-recipe/).

## Why?

Because sourdough is hard enough to deal with. You shouldn't have to manually change the times, servings and sizes, too.

## Changelog

### v1.0.1

- Fix timing issues and add extra reactivity logic. Also, round numbers so there aren't huge floating-point values mucking up the ingredients list.

### v1.0.0

Init!
